I'm excited to report the completion of my second machine learning task: customer segmentation for a retail store. This task involved creating a K-Means clustering algorithm, which essentially groups customers based on their purchase history.

K-Means works by identifying distinct clusters within the data, where each cluster represents a customer segment with shared buying behaviors. I achieved this by analyzing customer purchase data, such as Annual Income and spending score. Through this process, I determined the optimal number of customer groups and assigned them accordingly.

This project not only solidified my understanding of unsupervised learning techniques but also highlighted the power of K-Means clustering in segmenting customer bases. It further emphasized the importance of feature selection in building effective machine learning models.
